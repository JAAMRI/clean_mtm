            <p>“Time is our most valuable resource. It’s precious. It’s something we can’t ever get back, and some days there just never seems to be enough of it.”</p>
            <p>“For many like myself I find the biggest time waster is often in the kitchen. First, I’m just trying to figure out what I want to eat. Then it comes finding a recipe I could possibly use, buying the ingredients at the grocery store, and then coming back home to start prepping the ingredients. Before you know it, hours passed by and I end up re-heating a frozen pizza in the oven because it just became the easiest thing to do. No matter how hard I try to re-energize my creative cooking juices and try a new recipe at home, often the lazy gene just kicks in and I revert back to old habits…aka… leftovers and microwaveable dinners!” </p>

                “If you can even remotely relate to any of that, just know that you are not alone! I was one of those people and admittedly will still sometimes indulge in a frozen pizza or two, but I’m excited to tell you that I recently learned about a revolutionary way to make meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking a wide array of diverse and delicious recipes so much easier and pain free, enter Meals That Matter. The best part of it all is it involves my wanderlust tendencies of wanting to travel the world and try out as many types of worldly cuisines as possible. There’s only so many times one can eat frozen pizza for dinner a week, and with my past travels to Italy a few years ago, the memory of eating the finest Italian cuisine in the world made me want to re-create it back at home.”

            <p>“My absolute favourite part of using Meals That Matter is just the sheer variety of recipes at my disposal. From Asian to Italian, Mexican, and Indian to name a few, I feel like I’m travelling the world just from my very own kitchen as I divulge into new and exotic flavours I was not familiar with before and too intimidated to try. With my passion for food and travel, this is the perfect vessel for me to pursue big, global flavours in my daily cooking routine at home. It was like traveling to Tel Aviv for the first time while I made shakshuka, back to Rome with a four-cheese risotto, or to my birthplace of Hong Kong with an orange chicken stir-fry. All simple and delicious recipes found on the platform.” </p>

            <p>“With all that food and travel inspiration found at Meals That Matter.com, it was a true honour when I was also asked to share one of my own personal favourite recipes that has been a staple in my family.”  </p>
            <p>“Eggs have always been one of my favourite things to eat. Whether it comes poached, scrambled, or sunny-side-up, I welcome it served every which way. Growing up in a family that always loved entertaining guests, “Deviled Eggs” were almost always a dish that my mom would make every time we had anyone over. I think that’s probably why I loved having guests over all the time as a kid because it was almost a guarantee that a plate of Deviled Eggs would be served up on our dining table. And as to be expected, before the night was over, I would have indulged in at least a large handful all by myself!”</p>

            <p>“The classic deviled eggs recipe is quite simple as it consists of really just a hard-boiled egg and mayonnaise. I just absolutely love the creamy egg texture piped onto the egg vessel, and nothing beats the simplicity of finger food. The trick that I’ve learned to get that perfect egg mixture is to use quality mayonnaise. I use Hellman’s Real Mayonnaise that are made with only cage-free eggs. Hellman’s is the only brand of mayonnaise you’ll find in my fridge actually. It’s the quality I trust and is the magic ingredient to making the best Deviled Eggs possible.”  </p>

            <p>“In making this dish my own, I wanted to put a twist on the classic Deviled Eggs recipe and add some pizazz and personality to elevate the dish to the next level. My <a>“Beet & Avocado Deviled Eggs” </a> uses cooked beets and fresh avocados to not only inject some colour into the dish, but add some great new textures and flavours to the creamy egg mixture that we all have come to know and love. These Beet & Avocado Deviled Eggs are the perfect bite size appetizers to serve up to your guests, and from personal experience they will all be gone before you even know it!” </p>
