            <p>“I don’t know about you but I’m a huge fan of meal prepping and meal planning. As a food blogger and working professional with a Monday to Friday, 9-5 job, it really is a difficult task to get creative during the weekdays. That’s why I always try to (the keyword here is ‘try’) pre-plan my meals ahead of time so I don’t run into situations where I’m just making instant noodles for lunch or dinner. Sadly, it happens all too often!”</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Go to <a href="https://www.mealsthatmatter.com">MealsThatMatter.com</a> and browse through hundreds of step by step recipes (including the recipe I created! – Japanese Macaroni Salad)

                </li>
                <li>

                “If you need a little inspiration, feel free to look at my delicious Japanese Macaroni Salad recipe on the <a href="www.mealsthatmatter.com">Meals That Matter</a> site! It’s one of my go-to side dishes and it reminds me so much of Japan and Hawaii (my two favourite places to visit). I’ve also made it for potlucks many times before and they were always a hit with my friends and family!”

                “When making my Japanese Macaroni Salad, there are a few important things to remember. 1) Make sure not to skip removing the moisture from the onions and cucumbers. No one likes a wet macaroni salad! 2) The great thing about this recipe is that you can use Hellmann’s Real Mayonnaise, vinegar, and sugar to get that great authentic Japanese flavour in the macaroni salad. 3) Go easy on the Knorr Shichimi Togarashi seasoning at first and add more to taste. If you put too much in the beginning, it’s hard to remove the spiciness!”
